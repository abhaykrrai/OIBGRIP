                    Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima (Brazilian Portuguese: ; born 18 September 1976),[2] commonly known as Ronaldo, is a Brazilian business owner, president of Segunda División club Real Valladolid, owner of Brasileiro Série B club Cruzeiro, and a retired professional footballer who played as a striker. Popularly dubbed O Fenômeno ("The Phenomenon"),[3] and also nicknamed R9,[3] he is widely considered one of the greatest players of all time. As a multi-functional striker who brought a new dimension to the position, Ronaldo has been the influence for a generation of strikers that have followed. His individual accolades include being named FIFA World Player of the Year three times, and winning two Ballon d'Or awards.

               <h3>Performance</h3>
               <p>Ronaldo is regarded as one of the greatest and most complete forwards of all time.[62][70][197] Dubbed Il (or O) Fenomeno (the phenomenon), he was a prolific goalscorer, and despite being more of an individualistic attacker, he was also capable of providing assists for his teammates, due to his vision, passing and crossing ability.[70][198][199] He was an extremely powerful, fast, and technical player, with excellent movement, as well as being a composed finisher.[200][201][202] Highly regarded for his technical ability, Ronaldo was able to use both feet, despite being naturally right footed,[203][204] and is considered one of the most skilful dribblers in the game.[205] Along with Brazilian compatriot Romário and Liberian star George Weah, Ronaldo was seen as a new breed of striker in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal.[62][70] Often positioned near midfield, once in possession of the ball he would waste no time in making a beeline towards goal, with Rob Smyth writing, "he played like every attack had a 10-second deadline.. he would explode into life with no warning for defenders."[22] He frequently beat several players when dribbling at speed, and excelled in one on one situations, due to his ball control, acceleration, agility, balance and nimble footwork in his prime.[62][70][197][205]</p>
